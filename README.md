# CIFAR1-10 Image Classification

## Project Overview

This project involves the development and improvement of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, providing a basis for machine learning and computer vision research.

## Key Features
